# World Happiness Report Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the World Happiness Report dataset, exploring factors influencing happiness scores across countries. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization using Python, SQL queries with SQLite, and interactive dashboards created with Tableau.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Folder containing the World Happiness Report dataset (CSV file).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook with Python code for data analysis.
- `tableau/`: Tableau Workbook (.twbx) file for interactive dashboards.
- `visualization/`: Visualization file for the graphs and the dashboard.

## Tools and Languages Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQLite
- Tableau

## Steps

### 1. Data Collection
- Used the World Happiness Report dataset available at (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness/data?select=2019.csv).

### 2. Data Cleaning and Exploration (Python)
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
- Explored basic statistics of the dataset.
- Created visualizations for different factors impacting happiness.

### 3. Data Analysis (SQL)
- Executed SQL queries to gain deeper insights into the data.
- Analyzed correlations, regional disparities, and the impact of various factors on happiness.

### 4. Data Visualization (Tableau)
- Connected to the dataset in Tableau.
- Explored data visually using sheets.
- Created dashboards to showcase regional disparities, trends over time, and comparative analyses.
- Added interactivity features in Tableau.

## GitHub Repository
- https://github.com/Cgdsblc/happiness-business-analysis

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook to view the Python code and visualizations.
3. Execute SQL queries in your preferred SQL environment using the provided queries.
4. Open the Tableau Workbook to interact with the Tableau dashboards.

## Future Steps
- The analysis could be extended with additional datasets or refined visualizations.
- Since the project was held around Business Analysis; Market Research, Competitive Analysis, SWOT Analysis, etc. should be done after the Data Analysis.
- Machine learning models could be explored for predictive analysis.

## Challenges Faced
- Challenges in using Prompt Engineering for integrating Business Analysis and Data Analysis were overcome through learning and experimentation.
